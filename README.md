# TrafficSignRecognition
Traffic Sign Recognition Using German Dataset from Kaggle with deep learning in python

What is Traffic Sign Recognition??

There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

What is the need for Traffic Sign Recognition Project?? OR What is the Applications of Traffic Sign Recognition Project?

You must have heard about the self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.
In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

About the Python Project:

We will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

DataSet For Project:

German Traffic Sign Dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.
